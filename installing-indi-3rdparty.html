<br><br>

<b>a)</b> Search for the driver package with:

<pre>apt search indi-SOMETHING</pre>

(where <i>SOMETHING</i> is, for example, your camera vendor), and then install it with:

<pre>sudo apt install PACKAGE</pre>

Or, you can:

<br><br>

<b>b)</b> Install all available INDI 3rd-party drivers (approximately 340 MB) with:
<pre>sudo apt install indi-3rdparty-all</pre>
To see which driver packages are included, type:
<pre>apt info indi-3rdparty-all</pre>
and read the package description.
